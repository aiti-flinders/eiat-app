## A Note on Input-Output Modelling

The Economic Impact Assessment Tool (EIAT) allows users to estimate the impact of an investment activity in a region (Local Government Area) in terms of gross regional product (GRP) and employment.

Underpinning the EIAT are Input-Output tables for Australia and individual LGAs. Input-Output tables represent how expenditure flows between industries in terms of purchases and sales. They also contain the primary inputs into production such as wages and salaries (the labour input) and other value added. Input-Output tables quantify the structure of an economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics generates an Input-Output table each year, which describes the Australian economy in terms of 114 industry groups.

Input-Output modelling uses Input-Output tables to quantify the impact of expenditure in one industry based on how that industry makes purchases. For example, in order to build a new road, (a *direct* expenditure) a construction company must purchase goods and services from other construction companies, as well as businesses in other sectors of the economy, which may include chemicals, machinery and equipment, electricity, as well as direct labour. In turn, the businesses who sell their goods and services to the construction company also make their own purchases. A machinery and equipment hire business makes purchases from other industries, and utilises direct labour from their own employees. Employees also spend their labour income on consumable goods such. These additional purchases (*indirect* expenditures) can be added to the direct effect of the construction project to create an estimate of its total impact.

The flow from a direct expenditure does not continue without limit because input-output tables are leaky. Expenditures which occur outside the economy (ie, those expenditures which are imported) do not contribute.

## 2. What EIAT/IO modelling is not

While private and public stakeholders can use this powerful tool to conduct preliminary Input-Ouput analysis, it is recommended that expert consultants are engaged for a full and detailed report on the estimations of economic impacts, and the interpretations.

## 3. Using the EIAT

Before using the Economic Impact Assessment Tool (EIAT), it is important that the user considers how the investment being analysed interacts with the region it will occur. The most important consideration is how much of the expenditure will occur within the region. Any expenditure which occurs outside the region can not be used to estimate either the economic impact in terms of Gross Regional Product, or employment. The tool is not designed to correct for this, and will not provide any warnings or errors if expenditure outside the region is included in the input data. The analyst should therefore have some local knowledge of the economic structure of the region in order to estimate how much could potentially be sourced from within the region.

When this data has been collected, the EIAT can be accessed [here](https://aiti.shinyapps.io/eiat-app/). The landing page provides a description of the tool, a summary of the data used, and the current version of the Regional Input-Output tables used. It also reiterates the assumptions present in Input-Output modelling, and the information required to use the tool correctly.

### Setting project parameters

![](images/paste-B74C942E.png)

The project parameters can be adjusted by selecting **Project Setup** from the navigation bar at the top of the page. First select the State, and then the Local Government Area of interest.

### Entering data

There are two options to enter data into the tool. For relatively simple analyses you can first select the number of years into the future over which the investment will continue. It is by default set to 1, and the first year is the current year.

Next, enter the direct capital expenditure for each industry sector into the table. Remember that these expenditures must be in basic (sometimes called producer) prices - that is, they should exclude margins, taxes, and subsidies - and must only be for expenditure which will occur (or are expected to occur) within the region.

If you have a more complicated analysis, or want to keep a record of the estimated expenditures, a template can be downloaded, based on the parameters set above which can be opened in Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, or Google Sheets. This file can be renamed, but only .csv files will be accepted by the tool. Once the data has been entered into the template, it can be uploaded using the 'Uploaded Data' button.

> Sometimes, something may go wrong. The tool expects the file that you upload to look like the file that you downloaded. If you upload a file that has too many years of data, or does not have appropriate column names, the tool will warn you, and upload the data. If you upload a file that can not be read, the tool will show you an error, and reset the data.

### Economic impacts

Once you have entered the direct capital expenditure data you can see a summary of the input data by selecting the Input Summary tab from the navigation panel. The summary tables summarise the total direct capital expenditure in the region by year, and by industry and year. These tables can be downloaded, copied to clipboard, or printed, by clicking the relevant button.

The summary graphs visualises the input data by year, and by industry and year. These graphs can also be downloaded as .png, .jpeg, and .pdf using the controls shown below the graph.

The estimated economic impacts in terms of employment, and Gross Regional Products can be seen by selecting the Economic Impacts tab from the navigation panel. For both employment impacts, and GRP impacts, annual and total tables and graphs can be viewed.

The annual impacts table shows the estimated Direct, Flow-on and Total employment or GRP generated through the direct capital expenditure entered into the tool. Each years data can be exported, or viewed as a graph.

| Multiple years can be selected in the annual impacts tables - but will not dis-aggregate impacts by direct and flow-on - showing only the totals. 

The total impacts table shows the total estimated Direct, Flow-on, and Total employment or GRP generated across the entire duration of the investment.

### Other features

#### Report

A report summarising the economic impact assessment of a project can be automatically generated by selecting Report from the navigation panel. The report can be produced as either a PDF or Word Document, and you can choose the level of detail to include by selecting which tables and graphs to include.

#### Base Data

The tool includes a 19 sector version of the national input-output table, a summary of employment in the selected region, and the derived 19 sector version of the regional input-output table, for the selected region. These can each be exported to Excel.

## Technical Matters

### Data sources

The EIAT draws on data from the following sources:

-   The Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2021

    -   The Census provides information on the number of people who work in a region by industry, and the number of people who work and live in a region by industry.

    -   The data set is accessed through the ABS TableBuilder Pro

    -   2021 Census - counting persons, 15 years and over. INDP Industry of Employment, Local Government Areas (2022 Boundaries) (POW) and Local Government Areas (2022 Boundaries) (UR)

-   The Australian Bureau of Statistics National Input-Output Table.

    -   Australian National Accounts: Input-Output Tables 2019-20 financial year.

    -   Table 5. Industry by industry flow table (direct allocation of imports).
